## Selenium-Grid

1.测试多个浏览器或单个浏览器多个版本，或测试不同操作系统上各种浏览器

2.减少测试套件运行时间

Selenium Grid 包含一个Hub 和至少一个 Node，两者都可由 selenium-server-standalone.jar 文件启动

Selenium Grid 的部署

In the open source community, Selenium is the current leader in automation testing frameworks. Selenium grid runs tests in parallel on multiple machines and manages different browser versions and browser configurations centrally. This interactive workshop teaches attendees how to setup a Selenium test grid utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS). Jacqueline will walkthrough step-by-step choosing, provisioning, and configuring EC2 instances for both the hub and nodes. Learn what VPCs, subnets, and Security Groups are and how to configure them. Learn how to quickly expand your test grid as needed. Utilizing AWS’s free tier, attendees have the option to follow along on their laptops and walk away with their own personal Selenium test grid in the cloud and the skills needed to create one for their company. Join Jacqueline and set Selenium up properly the first time.  Save yourself time on settings and configurations.  Configure correctly once only!



## Selenium + Browserstack

Automated testing has become an industry standard for all the organizations. The golden standard of automated testing against a real browser is Selenium. In this breakout session, Randy will demonstrate how to use Selenium with Browserstack, which allows your web applications to test in almost every combination of browser and OS/device you can think of, all from your web browser. Randy will demonstrate how to spins up the right VM that gives you a remote screen to play around. Amazingly, after attending this session, you will solve your problem of cross browser testing your application with 1000+ combinations, reduce the testing cycle, and find cross platform compatible issues early.
